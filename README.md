## Patterns for `async` processing in Node.js or JavaScript

Please **Star** the repo :)

### Installing

I've tested these with Node 4.x, 5.x will probably work the same.

```
npm install
```

*npm install will read the package.json file, where I've specified async as a dependency*

### Running

To run the Queue example:

```
node sprint.js
```

* Task: can you randomize the runners entering the track / queue in this file?
